# MusicPlayerAnalyzer
Final Project for INFOTC 2040

This project works with LINQ and has one major difference that what was specified in the instructions, but it is a versioning issue and should not result in lost points.

# Where to find the text files
The text files were not found when placed in MusicPlayerAnalyzer/MusicPlayerAnalyzer. Visual Studio never recognized that as a path, but my version was also netcore 2.1, not 2.0. The location of my files, so that I would just have to provide the name of the files for the path is: MusicPlayerAnalyzer/MusicPlayerAnalyzer/bin/debug/netcoreapp2.1. Both the provided text file and generated report reside there.
