# MusicPlayerAnalyzer
Final Project for INFOTC 2040

This project works with LINQ and has one major difference that what was specified in the instructions, but it is a versioning issue and should not result in lost points.

# Where to find the text files
**MusicPlayerAnalyzer/MusicPlayerAnalyzer/bin/debug/netcoreapp2.1**
The text files were not found when placed in MusicPlayerAnalyzer/MusicPlayerAnalyzer. Visual Studio never recognized that as a path, but my version was also netcore 2.1, not 2.0. If you are looking for both the provided text file and generated report, look there. Visual Studio threw a fit when I tried to place them in MusicPlayerAnalyzer/MusicPlayerAnalyzer, and have been for other challenges, so I supplied the path I used above in **BOLD**.
